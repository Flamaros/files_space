# Experimental personnal project

I took RAD Debugger as the base for some personal experimentations.

I aim to see if I can work the way I learned at Epitech with simple tools.
Here are the tools I target to use together:
  * C as main language (I already use a subset of C++ on f-lang)
  * Focus editor (Simple developer text editor (I was using Emacs at Epitech))
  * Raddegger or RemedyBG

Why do I choose to start with raddbg code instead of from scratch like I did for f-lang? Because I like
the raddbg UI very much. A few things like window resizing, shortcuts, copy/past,... just work as I expect.

I also want to try metagen, because I did something close to that conceptually on a professional project.
So I am curious how it can be to use that more generically.

As you can now understand I have no real goal behind this project.
